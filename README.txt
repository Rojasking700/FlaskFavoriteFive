I tried to do this using classes and object so i could add many artist and to one genre
automatically but couldnt seem to figure it out. This is the latest working version im 
sure we will go over how to do integrate objects with this later.


as of now there is nothing in the index but by using the nav bar you can go through my 
favorite genres and top artist

ps sorry for any typos in this read me i just gave up by now
